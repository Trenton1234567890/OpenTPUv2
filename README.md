This repo is an extension of the UCSB OpenTPU architecture. all functionality from the previous architecture has been preserved, but this is for improvements and operation additions to the current standard. Improvements desired include

1. Matrix Addition/Bias Addition
2. Maxpool Operation
3. LSTM
4. Global Pool

Additional considerations:

5. Space2Batch?/Batch2Space? potentially not required
6. slicing?
